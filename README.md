> Why install the required dependancies when you can install them all

Please don't actually run npm install, the package.json is 17mb+ and the node_modules folder will be huge. Currently ~650,000 dependancies.

## Installing / Getting started

You can try install running npm install (hasn't been tried, may cause computer issues)

```shell
npm install
```

If your computer survives let me know.

## Licensing

Unlicence.
